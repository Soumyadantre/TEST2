        <h2> Hello Reader</h2>
        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
            The mind, a compass spinning fast,
            On every worry, every task.<br>
            You see the world in shades so deep,
            Where shadows dance, and secrets sleep.<br><br>
            
            Is this a storm, a troubled sea?
            Or just a mind worn, wanting to be free?<br>
            It's noble, friend, to feel so much,
            But burdens carried, tire us all as such.<br><br>
            
            Perhaps it's not a twisted mind,
            But simply one that's left behind.<br>
            The world can rush, a frantic pace,
            Leaving us breathless, longing for grace.<br><br>
            
            So take a breath, and let it slow,
            This feeling's weight, it doesn't grow<br>
            From broken parts, but from a gaze
            That sees too much in life's complex maze.<br><br>
            
            Rest your eyes, and quiet the fight,
            There's beauty still in gentle light.<br>
            A mind that ponders, open wide,
            Isn't a burden, but a place to confide.<br><br>
            
            Let gentle thoughts, like whispers come,
            And chase away the mental hum.<br>
            You're not unwell, just needing rest,
            A weary mind, deserves the best.<br><br>
        </p>
